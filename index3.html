  <p>Tech Analyst by day and baker by night.  That is my current motto.  I have been working with technology most of my life.  It started with an old Texas Instruments computer and evolved to Commodore 64.  Eventually, my family and school were inundated with PCs (Dells).</p>
  <p>In my spare time, I enjoy baking something that took a bit of time and patience to learn, but the results have been worth it.  I also enjoy dancing and going out to the theater, as well as, traveling.  Lastly, I am trying to get back into photography.</p>
